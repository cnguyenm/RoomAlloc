## Brief description
As students, we believe that it would be helpful to know what 
study spaces on campus are available for us to use and have the ability to reserve such areas when they available. 
Specifically, we feel that it is necessary to have a web application that can display campus study rooms,
allow users to see how long these rooms are reserved for, and reserve available rooms for themselves. 
We believe that creating this application will help prevent the difficulties and hassle that students may experience when trying to find a place to study on campus.
